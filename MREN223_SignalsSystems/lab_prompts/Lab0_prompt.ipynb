    "\n",
    "In this course, we will use Python for the labs. This introductory lab will help guide you in installing the required libraries and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can code Python on the Queen's lab computers on Anaconda.\n",
    "Access AppsAnywhere (https://apps.engineering.queensu.ca) and open Anaconda. \n",
    "You might have to open it twice, as it might fail to open the first time, or it might take some time to open the first time you use it.\n",
    "Anaconda's dashboard will have Jupyter and Spyder. Jupyter is the environment we used to create this lab, and you can rely on it for this course. If you want a more advanced Python IDE (for e.g., to allow you to debug your code), Spyder is a good option.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Python on your personal computer (if you do not already have it and want to work with your personal computer), follow the instructions on this link (https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download it. Versions newer than Python 3.4 (released March 2014) and Python 2.7.9 (released December 2014) ship with pip.\n",
    "pip is the package installer for Python that we will use to install packages from the Python Package Index. The packages we'll need include \n",
    "\n",
    "```pip install numpy scipy matplotlib notebook```\n",
    "\n",
    "So go ahead and install these packages by running the above command in your Python terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "These libraries are already available on Queen's lab computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can rely on jupyter notebook for this course (which 'notebook' in the above command refers to). But if you want a more advanced IDE, we recommend JetBrain's Pycharm Community which is free to download and use. You can install it by following the instructions in this link (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the packages are installed, you can open Jupyter by typing \n",
    "\n",
    "```jupyter notebook```\n",
    "\n",
    "in the Python console.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to Python, there are so many online tutorials that you can learn Python with, we did not know which to refer you to.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend the following to familiarize yourself with Numpy:\n",
    "https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to dedicate time to learn about Scipy and matplotlib, as we will just be using a few functions here and there from those libraries. So it is completely up to you if you want to review an online source covering either Scipy and matplotlib."
