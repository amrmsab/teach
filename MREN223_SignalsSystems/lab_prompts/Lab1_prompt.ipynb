    "In this lab, we will look at frequency spectrums, Fourier analysis, and signal filtering to design a pedometer. \n",
    "\n",
    "A pedometer counts each step a person takes by detecting the motion of the person's hands or hips. We will use the inertial measurement unit (IMU), containing a 3-axis accelerometer, on an Arduino Nano to generate motion data of a hand, and then process this data to count the number of steps.\n",

    "We advise you to scroll down to the lab description, and do steps (1) and (2) to get the Arduino work started. As it is taking its time to upload the sketch to the board, you can come up here and read the lab introduction. "
