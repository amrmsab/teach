# MREN223 LAB DEVELOPMENT

I developed a set of 4 Python (Jupyter notebook) based labs for the new MREN223 Signals and Systems at Queen's University in Summer 2022.

The labs and their goals are:

0) Introduce students to signals, including time signals and image signals, and mathematical operations, such as convolution. The advanced lab tasks asked students to test and design 2D image filters.
1) An Arduino unit was used to developed a pedometer. Students processed motion-sensor data to extract and count walking steps. 
The goal was to assess students understanding of Fourier and their ability to process signals to extract data.
2) Students processed music to drone dance choreographs. The dances were animated. The goal was to introduce students to systems. 
3) Students designed an old telephone line, converting an audio speech signal to a digital signal and then reproecessing the audio. The main advanced topic was the Nyquist rate.

The labs relied on animation to enhance student learning. 

For example, the following animation aims to explain convolution.

And the following is an example of drone dance to music (no audio)
