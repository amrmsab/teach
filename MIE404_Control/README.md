# MIE404 Control System

I TAed this course for 4 semesters between 2019 and 2022, taking on various roles.

I mainly was responsible for tutorial design and delivery, and delivered several lectures.
I was also responsible for designing assignments and exam questions.

The Sample Assignments folder contains a few sample assignments that I designed that are focused on assessing the student's advanced comprehesion of the subject matter.

The Sample Class folder contains a sample lecture support material. I rely on MATLAB livescripts in support on lecture notes in on-board lectures to visually explain material.
